# Frontend Styling Fix Instructions

## Issue
The frontend is showing a white screen due to Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility issues.

## Solution
I've downgraded Tailwind CSS to v3.4.1 and fixed the configuration files.

## Steps to fix:

1. **Navigate to frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Remove old dependencies:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

3. **Install fresh dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Alternative: Use the fix script
From the gramchat directory:
```bash
./fix-frontend.sh
```

## What was changed:
- Downgraded from Tailwind CSS v4 to v3.4.1
- Removed @tailwindcss/postcss dependency (not needed for v3)
- Fixed PostCSS configuration
- Removed styles.css import from main.tsx

## Testing
After starting the dev server, navigate to:
- http://localhost:5173/test - Should show a blue background with white card
- http://localhost:5173/login - Should show the styled login page

## If styles still don't work:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure the backend is running on port 3000
